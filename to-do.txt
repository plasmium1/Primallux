Finish magic system

Add more tiles

Add the Moonreach Guild so gold and quests can be gained (Only need to finish interactions!)

Actually implement the timer function (Done for status effects, untested for resource regen (this is implemented), night/day cycles and other time-varying conditionals also not implemented, random event cycles also not implemented)

Implement magic casting (Done for mobs, not done for players)

Fix the bug of status effects having their levels reset when loading back in. (FINISHED)

Make resource tiles work, and test it out - (FINISHED)

Work out nighttime at specific turn intervals. I'm thinking of making it every 250? 500? turns.

Arena system: (Either I can try to make this multiplayer or keep it nice and simple and just go single.)
Wins in arena give "Carnage Points" to be redeemed for certain special loot.

 - Multiplayer:
 -> One player does a move
 -> The other player does a move
 -> Things go back and forth. Moves are processed through a server which allocates damage numbers and effects to targets much like how the save/load system works, but instead it's passing things through a flask server run on another separate repl. 
 - Singleplayer:
 -> Player does a move.
 -> NPC does a move.
 -> Just like a normal monster fight but this one offers extra rewards like Reputation or maybe even a special currency only offered at arenas to push people there more often. Arena scales up/down in terms of difficulty depending on how well the player's been doing in the Arena (KDR, and player stat totals).

Dialogue system <- Finished!

Merchant system:
 - Buy items (FINISHED)
 - Haggle (Might need a nerf for this) (FINISHED) (Nerfed.)
 - Reputation buffs and debuffs enhance the prices accordingly. (Uh)

Haggling system (FINISHED!):
 - Player begins to buy/sell an item. Given a prompt to increase price, or decrease price of the item.
 - Each time the value increases when the player's buying, the merchant is more likely to accept, while if it's >= than the original value, the merchant accepts immediately, provided the player has the money. Opposite applies when value is decreased when buying.
 - Player can freely set the new price, just that price cannot go below 0.

Crafting: (FINISHED, HELL YEAH) (Finished and tested)
 - Smithing (Forge) < Mining 
 - Alchemy (Cauldron) < Herbalism
 - Tinkering (Workbench) < Salvaging
 - Jeweling (Toolkit) < Mining
 - Runation (Inscription Pen) < Mining/Salvaging
 - Cooking (Pot) < Fishing/Hunting
At certain levels in the crafting skills, there may be additional bonuses like increased yield, maybe even a modifier system for making more customized crafting recipes?
At certain levels in the gathering skill, there may be additional bonuses like increased yield.

Tile searching respawns, rss respawns, and monster respawns. (FINISHED)

Make item description viewing a thing?

Creating an alternate Personal version meant to be downloaded and not quite run on Repl.it, with the original data saving system that works with files rather than the Repl DB

Quests (Actual quests not finished, but system works.)

Quest hall interactible!!! (Added, untested)

Library interactible for managing buying into skill levels and handling item enchantment.

Mob defence move for more complex fights.

Make a login thing since REPL_OWNER doesn't work in forcing .

putting (FINISHED) at the end of things is hella satisfying lol
