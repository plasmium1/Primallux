Finish magic system

Add more tiles

Add the Moonreach Guild so gold and quests can be gained (Working on this, too)

Actually implement the timer function (Done for status effects, untested for resource regen, night/day cycles and other time-varying conditionals also not implemented, random event cycles also not implemented)

Implement magic casting (Done for mobs, not done for players)

Fix the bug of status effects having their levels reset when loading back in. (FINISHED)

Make resource tiles work, and test it out - (FINISHED)

Work out nighttime at specific turn intervals. I'm thinking of making it every 250? 500? turns.

Dialogue system <- Finished!
 - This uses various different characters in its key string to specify conditions that need to be met for a specific response.
 -- The [letter]) character, literally a closing parenthesis, specifies what character needs to be inputted to choose that response.
 -- The | character is a split character, and should be checked fairly late in the chain. It's to check the conditionals like Turns and Quests. This HAS to be included in every single dialogue.
 -- The & character marks what round of talking it is. Best to put this after the Conditional if there is one.
 -- The ^ character marks what sort of follow-up message group comes after selecting a specific preceding response. Ex: {"a)Greet the person":"Hello!", "d)Ask them how they're doing^a":"I'm doing well, thanks!"} -> (Select a):"Hello!" (print d)Ask them how they're doing):"I'm doing well, thanks!"
 --- NOTE: ALWAYS PUT THIS AT THE END. 

Merchant system:
 - Buy items (FINISHED)
 - Haggle (Might need a nerf for this) (FINISHED)
 - Reputation buffs and debuffs enhance the prices accordingly. (Uh)

Haggling system (FINISHED!):
 - Player begins to buy/sell an item. Given a prompt to increase price, or decrease price of the item.
 - Each time the value increases when the player's buying, the merchant is more likely to accept, while if it's >= than the original value, the merchant accepts immediately, provided the player has the money. Opposite applies when value is decreased when buying.
 - Much like buying, selling works like above, but reversed. Selling doesn't work for some reason, it just ends up skipping the whole program.
 - Player can freely set the new price, just that price cannot go below 0.

Crafting: (FINISHED, HELL YEAH) (well, the system works, but most of these aren't implemented)
 - Smithing (Forge) < Mining 
 - Alchemy (Cauldron) < Herbalism
 - Tinkering (Workbench) < Salvaging
 - Jeweling (Toolkit) < Mining
 - Runation (Inscription Pen) < Mining/Salvaging
 - Cooking (Pot) < Fishing/Hunting

putting (FINISHED) at the end of things is hella satisfying lol
