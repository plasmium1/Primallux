Pretty much, to do anything here, you just need to type out whatever action it is you want to do, and then press enter to register it. 

**NSEW, (North, South, East, West)** - These are used for traveling from tile to tile.

**Wander** - Picks a random direction for you to go in.

**L, Look, Search** - Search the tile you're in, for a chance of loot...or meeting a monster!

**Interact, Int** - Available only at specific areas, but used when you meet an NPC or other interactibles. Can be used to enter and exit dungeons, alongside gathering tile-specific resources.

**Inv, Inventory** - Open your player inventory, equip, use consumables, et cetera.

**Stats** - Check your player stats sheet.

**Skills** - Check your player skills sheet.

**M, Magic** (Not implemented) - Use magic! Opens the magic menu. Can also be used in combat!

__In-fight Controls__ 

**A, F, Attack, Fight** - Perform a melee attack, and deal damage in your damage range, provided you land the hit.

**D, Defend** - Perform a defensive move, with a chance of mitigating all damage from the next attack, or half of it, or none at all.

**C, Consumable** - Use a consumable from your inventory.

**R, Run, Flee** - Attempt to escape from your enemy.

**P, Pacify** - Attempt to convince your enemy not to keep fighting you. Successful pacification results in increased Reputation with that faction.

`Primallux` was created out of a passion for the nostalgia of old text-based role-playing games. Over several iterations of a similar idea, I've finally managed to produce a working "game," that's finally managed to reach the quality that I've been working toward. 

`Primallux` involves several systems that make up the central matter of its creation. Its main premise is similar to Zork and Collossal Cave Adventure, though with several new features as of a result of the oncoming, more modern, times.
We have: 
- A (planned) system of Magic, where a person can gather runes, and slot them in and cast! Much like equipping and unequipping items.

- A detailed stat system! Assign points to stats when you level up, in addition to a randomized amount generated on creation.

- A large, detailed, world to explore in the future!

- A nuanced reputation system to produce different NPC and monster encounters!

- Skills and crafting to allow the player to produce items registered in the system!
  
- Easily moddable with the framework that I've made, so it just takes the creation of a few objects in a forked copy to create wholly new encounters! (Be sure to credit me, though! Thanks!)


-------------------------
| Planned Features: |
-------------------------

- Global time system, allowing us to specify respawns for items and monsters. NPCs will remain unrespawnable after death.
- Magic system based upon equippable, upgradeable, runes.
- A weapon upgrade system, based upon the magic system, thus needing the usage of mana as a currency.
- Quests! Go on quests, and experience a structured storyline, all the while gathering a reward as you go!
- More dungeons! And, of course, a dungeon Boss for the cave!
- Faction disputes! In specific global times, a global event will come that likely changes many things in various encounters while the game goes on!
