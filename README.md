```Primallux``` is an open-world, text-based RPG game, where the player travels through a large tile-based world, raiding dungeons and various other points of interest.

`Primallux` was created out of a passion for the nostalgia of old text-based role-playing games. Over several iterations of a similar idea, I've finally managed to produce a working "game," that's finally managed to reach the quality that I've been working toward. 

`Primallux` involves several systems that make up the central matter of its creation. Its core systems run mostly upon things similar to Zork and Collossal Cave Adventure, though with several new things as of a result of the oncoming, more modern, times.

A (planned) system of Magic, where a person can gather runes, and slot them in and cast! Much like equipping and unequipping items.

A detailed stat system! Assign points to stats when you level up, in addition to a randomized amount generated on creation.

A large, detailed, world to explore in the future!

A nuanced reputation system to produce different NPC and monster encounters!
